## Introduction

- Emacs, is an acryonm which stands for, Escape, Meta, Alr, Control, Shift.  

- Emacs, is normally a Linux based editor program; however, it can also be used cross platform: Linux/Mac/Windows/BSD/-etc.  

- I've heard it said that Emacs editor has 10,000 commands...???!!!  

- Emacs, is programmable as it uses bulit-in ELisp.

- Emacs, can be used NOT just as being merely a text editor; but, also, to achieve multi-farious purposes: 
-- editor
-- playing games
-- programming (ELisp)
-- file browser
-- etc.

## My own personal computing history

Personally speaking, I didn't start out using Linux...; instead, I started out using only Windows software.  

Of course, I did hear of Linux OS having been mentioned before...in fact, repeatedly; but, I never really knew what it was by having had any actual 'hands on' experience.

Anyway, to go cut a long story short...; one day I was experimenting with putting a CD-ROM disc into my Windows 10 computer...; and, running Linux Mint from there.

Then, another day, I decided to try and set up a 'dual boot' computer system...that would allow me to run both Windows/and, Linux Mint together at once. 

Much to my utter dismay...Windows 10, had gotten completely 'deleted'...; and, I was left with no other choice but to run Linux Mint on its own.

It's, now, been around 2 years, later on; and, I still prefer using Linux Mint...rather than return back to using Windows, anymore.

I find Linux Mint does nearly all of the things that Windows can do...; and, perhaps, even much more.

ADVANTAGES  

- I can browse the internet just like usual...   
- Linux software is FREE  
- I no longer need to 'buy/update' Anti-virus software...as Linux seems to be a pretty secure system.  
- I can both download/run multiple different programming languages.  
- Etc.  

DISADVANTAGES  

I no longer have access to such things as...  
- CMD, Powershell, VBScript, -etc.  
- Certain Windows software I was using before...; isn't available for use of Linux (but, there is usually some equivalent package)  


Right now, I'm just starting out to use it...having just installed it, today;    
so, I can hardly say I understand how to use it properly, yet;      
or, that I know how this software fully functions.

## Installation

I'm using Linux Mint OS/Operating System; onto which I installed Emacs editor program using the following command:

> sudo apt install emacs

...next, I was asked for an admin password; which I subsequently entered;   
then, the installation started happenning...;  
at one point I was asked if it's ok to use up memory space...to which I simply typed: y, meaning, yes;  
and, so the rest of the installation continued...until when the installation was finally all done.  

Once Emacs software had already been fully installed...I was greeted with the Emacs UI/User Interface window;  
which has File menu at the top/along with other options.

## My own experience so far...

I tried using the menu to create first text files(.txt)...which display as being just plain ordinary text;      
and, then, (.html) files...inside of the HTML file code syntax highlighting works.  

At one point I tried clicking on the menu option which said use Calculator;  
and, after the question mark prompt: ? I typed in 1+1/and, the answer appeared saying: 2.
