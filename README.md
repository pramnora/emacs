## Introduction

I'm using OS/Operating System: Linux Mint; and, I've just installed Emacs editor program.

> sudo apt install emacs

...next, I was asked for an admin password; which I subsequently entered;   
then, the installation started happenning...;  
at one point I was asked if it's ok to use up memory space...to which I simply typed: y, meaning, yes;  
and, so the rest of the installation continued...until when the installation was finally all done.  

Once Emacs software had already been fully installed...I was greeted with the Emacs UI/User Interface window;  
which has File menu at the top/along with other options.  

I tried using the menu to create first text files(.txt)...which display as being just plain ordinary text;      
and, then, (.html) files...inside of the HTML file code syntax highlighting works.  

At one point I tried clicking on the menu option which said use Calculator;  
and, after the question mark prompt: ? I typed in 1+1/and, the answer appeared saying: 2.
