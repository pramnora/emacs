## Introduction

I didn't start out using Linux...; but, instead, I started out using Windows software.  

However, due to an accident...I ended up deleting my Windows 10 OS/and, so ended up running Linux Mint.    

Emacs, is an editor program which I heard is used mostly by Linux users.   

However, as I've come to read...it also works cross platform on: Linux/Mac/Windows/BSD/-etc.    

It is said that Emacs editor has 10,000 commands...???

It is also said that it's NOT just an editor, alone; but, can have multiple uses:  
- editor
- playing games
- programming (ELisp)
- file explorer
- etc.

Right now, I'm just starting out to use it...having just installed it, today;    
so, I can hardly say I understand how to use it properly, yet;      
or, that I know how this software fully functions.

## Installation

I'm using Linux Mint OS/Operating System; onto which I installed Emacs editor program using the following command:

> sudo apt install emacs

...next, I was asked for an admin password; which I subsequently entered;   
then, the installation started happenning...;  
at one point I was asked if it's ok to use up memory space...to which I simply typed: y, meaning, yes;  
and, so the rest of the installation continued...until when the installation was finally all done.  

Once Emacs software had already been fully installed...I was greeted with the Emacs UI/User Interface window;  
which has File menu at the top/along with other options.

## Emacs built-in tutorial

To use the Emacs built-in tutorial...type in the command:  
C+h t, meaning, [CTRL]+[h] followed by [t]

## My own experience so far...

I tried using the menu to create first text files(.txt)...which display as being just plain ordinary text;      
and, then, (.html) files...inside of the HTML file code syntax highlighting works.  

At one point I tried clicking on the menu option which said use Calculator;  
and, after the question mark prompt: ? I typed in 1+1/and, the answer appeared saying: 2.
